        <summary><b>Week 7: Attaching Hardware</b></summary>
        <article>
          <p>With the desk tidy assembled, this week focuses on attaching small hardware like handles or hooks. Correct placement and screw technique keep your project sturdy.</p>  
          <h4>Key Points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Mark hardware positions carefully before drilling.</li>
            <li>Drill pilot holes to stop the timber splitting.</li>
            <li>Select screws just long enough to hold securely.</li>
            <li>Countersink if you want screw heads level with the surface.</li>
            <li>Use a screwdriver that fits the screw head properly.</li>
          </ul>
